## Project: Scones Unlimited – End-to-End ML Workflow on AWS

This project was completed as part of the AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree (Udacity). It demonstrates how to build, deploy, and monitor a complete ML workflow on Amazon SageMaker with supporting AWS services.

## Project Overview:

I designed and deployed a machine learning workflow to classify images for "Scones Unlimited" using AWS cloud tools. The workflow includes:

Training and deploying a SageMaker ML model

Exposing the model through an API endpoint

Using AWS Lambda functions for data serialization, classification, and post-processing

Orchestrating steps with AWS Step Functions

Monitoring model performance with Model Monitor

## Tech Stack:

Amazon SageMaker – Training, endpoint deployment, and monitoring

AWS Lambda – Pre- and post-processing logic

AWS Step Functions – Workflow orchestration

Amazon S3 – Data storage

CloudWatch – Logging and monitoring

## Learning Outcomes:

✔️ Train and deploy ML models on SageMaker

✔️ Build an end-to-end ML workflow with Step Functions

✔️ Author and test Lambda functions

✔️ Monitor and debug model performance

This project showcases MLOps on AWS — combining machine learning with scalable, production-ready cloud workflows.
